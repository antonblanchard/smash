# Gipfeli - A high-speed compression library

## About
[Gipfeli](https://github.com/google/gipfeli) is a high-speed compression/decompression library aiming at slightly higher compression ratios (around 30% less bytes produced for text) than other high-speed compression libraries. On a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, gipfeli compresses at about 180 MB/s or more and decompresses at about 300 MB/s, typically 5x faster than zlib, but does not quite achieve its compression density.
