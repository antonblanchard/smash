# Zstd - Fast real-time compression algorithm

## About
[Zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios.

## Options
### To compress
* **Compression level** - (integer, 1-22, default 1)
  * **1** - obtains the fastest compression.
  * **22** - obtains the highest compression ratio.
