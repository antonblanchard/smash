## About
[BriefLZ](https://github.com/jibsen/brieflz) is a small and fast open source implementation of a Lempel-Ziv style compression algorithm. The main focus is on speed and code footprint, but the ratios achieved are quite good compared to similar algorithms.

## Options
### To compress
* **Compression level** - (integer, 1-10, default 1)
  * **1** - obtains the fastest compression.
  * **10** - obtains the highest compression ratio.
