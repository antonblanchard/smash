# Xpack

## About
[Xpack](https://github.com/ebiggers/xpack) is an experimental compression format. It is intended to have better performance than DEFLATE as implemented in the zlib library and also produce a notably better compression ratio on most inputs. The format is not yet stable

## Options
### To compress
* **Compression level** - (integer, 1-9, default 1)
  * **1** - obtains the fastest compression.
  * **9** - obtains the highest compression ratio.
