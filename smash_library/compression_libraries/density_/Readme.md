# Density - Superfast compression library

## About
[Density](https://github.com/k0dai/density) is focused on high-speed compression, at the best ratio possible. All three of density's algorithms are currently at the pareto frontier of compression speed vs ratio (cf. here for an independent benchmark).

## Options
### To compress
* **Mode** - (integer, 1-3, default 1)
  * **1 - Chameleon algorithm**.
  * **2 - Cheetah algorithm**.
  * **3 - Lion algorithm**.
